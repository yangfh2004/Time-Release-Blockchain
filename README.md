# Time-Release Blockchain and Application
This project was a fork from [Sangoou's project](https://github.com/Sangoou/BlockchainEVote).

Some English translation has been added, and some code cleanup has been done.

In this repo, we aim to provide educational materials to test and learn a new design for time-release blockchain technology.
Moreover, some flaws in existing design would be fixed in our new design.
